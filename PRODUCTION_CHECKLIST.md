## Recommended Production RPC Providers

For reliability beyond public RPCs:

1. **QuickNode** (https://www.quicknode.com)
   - Dedicated endpoints
   - High reliability
   - $9/month starter plan

2. **Alchemy** (https://www.alchemy.com)
   - Free tier available
   - Robust infrastructure
   - Good Base support

3. **Infura** (https://www.infura.io)
   - Established provider
   - Free tier
   - Multiple fallbacks

4. **Base Public RPC** (fallback only)
   - https://mainnet.base.org
   - Free but rate-limited
   - Use as backup only

## Emergency Procedures

### If Contract Needs Pausing

```bash
# Connect as owner wallet
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "setPaused(bool)" true \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org \
  --private-key <OWNER_KEY>
```

### If Frontend Needs Taking Down

1. Set maintenance mode in deployment platform
2. Display user-friendly message
3. Communicate via social media
4. Fix issue
5. Redeploy
6. Announce restoration

**Remember**: Better to delay launch than deploy with issues!
